Pathfinding Visualizer — A* & DFS

An interactive Python application that visualizes how A* and DFS (Backtracking) algorithms navigate through a grid with obstacles.
The project uses Matplotlib animations to show each step of the pathfinding process, including real-time movement, trail drawing, and algorithm switching.

✨ Features

🔍 A* Search Algorithm (optimal pathfinding)
